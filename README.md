#### Why `customtkinter`?
Since I wanted the program to look good without having to create all the styles myself,
I decided to use `customtkinter`.
   

<br>

#### Why does this program exist?
As a part of my schools course on Object-Oriented-Programming, we had an assignment
of making the most unusable, but still working UI.

<br>

#### Does it work?
Yesn't

<br>

#### Would you use it yourself?
Absolutely not!
